# ACP agent runtime: external agents as ZCode providers (phases 1–3)

External ACP agents (`opencode`, `cursor-agent`) become ZCode providers: ZCode drives them over
newline-delimited JSON-RPC (Agent Client Protocol) on stdio, and Model Settings exposes detection,
activation, a roundtrip Test with raw frames, and login helpers. This spec is the product contract
for `packages/acp-agent-runtime` (lifecycle core), the `acp-agent` provider access type, and the
settings bridge/UI. Chat turn delegation (phase 4) is a follow-up.

Wire behavior was verified against `opencode` v2.0.31 and `cursor-agent` 2026.05.01 (spike traces);
the mock-agent tests encode the contract below.

## Product rules

- Agents are user-installed CLIs; ZCode never installs, updates or logs them in silently. Detection
  probes fixed binaries on the login-shell PATH (`opencode`, `cursor-agent` — never bare `agent`,
  which collides with unrelated CLIs) with fixed version-probe arguments only.
- An enabled agent becomes the personal provider `acp:<agentId>` with one synthetic model
  (`modelId = agentId`); ids are stable and validated (not taken, no whitespace). Until phase 4 the
  model stays out of the chat registry (`executable = false`).
- Permissions are answered by `kind` (`allow_once` / `allow_always` / `reject_once` /
  `reject_always`); an unavailable kind resolves to `cancelled`. Agents never see host-specific
  option ids.
- Environment: children inherit the parent env minus (a) privileged ZCode runtime keys via the
  shared sanitizer and (b) secret-named keys by segment. User capability sockets
  (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `KRB5CCNAME`, `GPG_AGENT_INFO`, …) are intentionally inherited — the agent is
  unsandboxed and acts for the user; explicit launch `env` overrides win, and `undefined` deletes.
- One active prompt per session. `cancel` sends a bounded `session/cancel` and escalates to a
  process-tree kill; `stop` is idempotent and safe to call at any time.

## State owner and lifecycle

Owner: one `AcpSessionRuntime` per agent process.

- States: `starting` → `ready` ⇄ `prompting`; terminal per process: `failed` or `stopped`.
- A prompt issued while `failed` transparently restarts the process and session.
- Teardown (`stop`, escalated cancel, handshake failure, fatal transport
  failure — an oversized frame or a closed stdout, even when the child process
  survives) marks the runtime `failed` (unless it is already `stopped`) BEFORE
  rejecting in-flight asks/prompts, so no rejected prompt can fall back to
  `ready` with a cleared connection; the next prompt then restarts.
- Teardown sequence: stdin EOF → `stopGraceMs` → SIGTERM (Windows: `taskkill /T`) →
  `killGraceMs` → SIGKILL (Windows: `taskkill /T /F`).
- Frame observer (`onFrame`): raw NDJSON lines per direction in wire order; lines over 16 KiB are
  truncated with a marker; observer exceptions are swallowed.

## Event ordering (runtime → host)

- Handshake: `initialize` (protocol version checked) → `session/new` — before any prompt.
- `session/update` notifications are mapped to typed events and only for the current session id
  (`message_chunk`, `thought_chunk`, `tool_call`, `tool_call_update`, `plan`, `usage`,
  `session_title`, `available_commands`); foreign session ids only increment an ignored counter.
- Exactly one `stopped` per prompt; `stalled` after `stallWarningMs` without frames; `process_exit`
  on child exit.

## Acceptance scenarios (encoded by tests)

- Full prompt with every update kind; restart after death; die-mid rejection; handshake timeout.
- Cancel: settle; cancelled-before-waiter race; escalation → state `failed` → next prompt restarts.
- Frame observer: capture in both directions; truncation; observer isolation; oversized frame error.
- Permissions: allow / deny / cancel mapping; fs bridge read/write; env scrubbing including
  capability inheritance and the per-launch opt-out.
- Registry: detection, safe version probes, cache, login/status argument declarations.
- Live (manual, macOS): enable both agents in Model Settings → Test green with raw frames → login
  status visible.
